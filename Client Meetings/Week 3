Week 3 meeting:

Introduced all 3 teams to the client.

Outlined what the company is aiming to achieve with regards to providing a platform that connects spiritual healers with clients who are dealing with failed pregancies. This platform not only assists in the scheduling but also handles the money exchange between the two parties. It will also provide the location of the healer as well as other key information for the clients. 

Summarized the main goals of the project and briefly mentioned the features each team is expected to work on, including improved searching functionality, mapping, and testing.

Talked about the name of the project, where it stems from, and potential alternatives. Current name is already taken for a service that deals with spirituality as well.  

Client sent emails with beginning instructions as well as technologies implmeneted by previous capstone students to give us an overview of what we will be working with.

Ended meeting with a brief review of main points and a quick Q&A.
