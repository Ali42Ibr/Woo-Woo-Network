Week 5 (10/08/2021):

All teams have the frontend working, but backend is giving everyone trouble
Cody reached out to a previous dev to get help, said to set up .env to install dependencies, didn’t work
Kimberlee could contact other 2 devs who worked on the backend, see if they know a trick to get it to work
Cass’s team is thinking about reworking the backend altogether
Cody saw the files on the db were all different types, and wants to swap the db other to mongodb
Cass suggested having the previous team to screen record them setting the db up
Kimberlee said she would send that idea to them
Backend currently has a lot of features implemented, would be a pain to rebuild
Kimberlee sent out a figma file detailing how the site would work https://www.figma.com/file/2oLK2HMwCJLuErpx9zilWb/The-Unforgotten-Ones?node-id=0%3A1
Kimberlee has another person Cody could contact who works at Telus, she hasn't reviewed the code
Kimberlee suggested meeting on discord next week instead of google meets

*Will be meeting in all teams discord next week*
