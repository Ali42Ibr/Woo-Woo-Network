	Remove/disable healers and clients
	Reporting mechanism

Kimberless can verify accounts after they’ve been created, to not slow down the sign up process
Simple layout, don’t need to know a lot about the backend to use
Kimberlee thinks search and location are good features to implement first
She’ll create a list of tags to search by

Add map to show healers close to the user
Search bar shown under global healing network box/just above browse our healers
Might be hard to validate if a person is a proper healer or not
