Week 7 (22 Oct 2021):

Met on google hangouts, as discord was inneficient. 
Working on getting all teams to have their back end and front end working by the end of the day. 
Discussed the placement of the search bar and possibility of adding filters. A portal for admin users was also talked about 
in order to facilitate the removal of useres that do not follow the terms and conditions. Some ethical concerns were raised regarding liability (Sponsor said she will deal with them).
