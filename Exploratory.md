Meeting Agenda

Introduced all 3 teams to the client.

Outlined what the company is aiming to achieve with regards to providing a platform that connects spiritual healers with clients who are dealing with failed pregancies. This platform not only assists in the scheduling but also handles the money exchange between the two parties. 

Summarized the main goals of the project and briefly mentioned the features each team is expected to work on, including improved searching functionality, mapping, and testing.

Talked about the name of the project, where it stems from, and potential alternatives. Current name is already taken for a service that deals with spirituality as well.  

Client sent emails with beginning instructions as well as technologies implmeneted by previous capstone students to give us an overview of what we will be working with.

Ended meeting with a brief review of main points and a quick Q&A.

Technologies Used

Front end - React: Advantages: High object reusibility. Disadvantages: Higher complexity than other front end languages. Not all team members are fluent with React. 

Back end - API implemented with Express.js: Advantages: API allows for a smooth and concise data flow.

Sendinblue - Advantages: Easy access to resources, support from company. Disadvantages: Lower customizability, subscription fee.

DBMS
Seqquelize - Allows us to communicate with relational databases more easily. It does not require as much code and is less redundant which saves time. This also makes the code more robust and secure. It also helps deal with multiple databses if that is a route our group ends up taking. 

SQLite - The relational DBMS we're implementing for production. Pros: SQLite is a server-less and self-contained database, meaning that we don't need a server to run it unlike MySQL for instance. Effective for small projects/standalone apps and for basic development and testing. Cons: SQLite's library is  smaller in size, less flexible when it comes to data types, and has less security built in. Not scalable. It also has limitations surrounding multi-user capabilities.
