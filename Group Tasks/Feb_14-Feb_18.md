This week the team is working on the tasks for peer testing session 2. Therefore we are all working on implementing the specific features that will be tested this upcoming milestone. 

The list of usability tasks for the testing session is added to the repo.

Note: List is not exhaustive.
      Certain tasks might be modified, added. or removed based on the team's progress, 
      as well as the testing of those features and whether they pass or unexpected issues occur.
