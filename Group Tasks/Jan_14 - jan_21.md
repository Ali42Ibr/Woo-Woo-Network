This last week has been all about updating client and professor on the team progress.
We are trying to catch up to where we left off before the winter break. This means
discussing next steps in order to reach our goals for the next milestone. 

We have all worked on a progress report for the client as well as the professor. 

We are also required to create a presentation sub 10 minutes for the TA for this term. 
This presentation will be the focus for the next week (as it is on Jan 28) alongside improvements on the project.
