Mohamad's been working on finishing up the peer testing report and peer evaluations.

Worked on extracting the issues from the sessions and ranking them based on priority.

Tried fixing one of the bugs but new error came up:
  healers are not displaying as usual, error seems to be due to new code added to home.jsx
  has to do with an async() clause. 

Once error is fixed, will probably give 'learn more' a new function or remove.

Make sure that clicking a healer name or card takes you to the profile/services page
rather than doing nothing and confusing user.

Priority is to make click direct properly, learn more function has less importance.
