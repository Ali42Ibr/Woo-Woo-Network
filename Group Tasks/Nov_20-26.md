Each group member prepared to take part in peer testing. We all participated in a think-aloud and walkthrough session as admins as well as participants. 
Sessions as admins were recorded and psrticipants filled out a user heuristic google form. Peer testing reports are being created and to be submitted before the deadline. 
Peer testing so far consisted of register and login as a user, filter/search for healer using search bar, navigate healer profiles.
