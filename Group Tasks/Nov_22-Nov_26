This week the team worked on the peer review sessions. We created an outline that our users could follow in order to test the software efficiently.
Furhtermore, we also generated a form that the users fill out at the end of each session. This will give us the feedback necessary to improve our product. 
We have also worked on developing a video or fridays submission that is a walk through of the features that have been implemented up to now.
