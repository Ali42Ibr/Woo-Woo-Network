Project Agenda


OCT 16-22:


For this week all group members (Ali, Mohamad, Daven, David) have worked on deploying the website properly. We discussed the primary features our project sponsor is looking for whilst exploring what differs a client from a healer (and if any legal qualifications are to be presented when signing up as a healer). 


Moreover, we worked on and finalized the group requirments report, each member worked on updating their parts from the video and integrate them into the report: 

-Ali : Updated functional requirements of our project with respect to the major milestones.
-Daven : Updated the non-functional requirements and the environmental constraints of the project.
-David : Updated on the Tech Stack and Testing Methodologies slides
-Mohamad : Updated the high-level project description alongside the level 0 and 1 DFDs.


Furthermore, each team member answered questions anonymously provided by students while using feedback to modify the report with any important details.
