Project Agenda


OCT 11-15


For this week all group members (Ali, Mohamad, Daven, David) are focused on running the previous code. Ali and Mohamad were able to get the site running by the client meeting on friday. There was also a focus to complete team reviews for the requirement presentations for the rest of the class. After receiving the reviews, changes were made to each of our allotted sections of the requirements report. Internal group evaluations for the requirements report were also due on friday this week. 

Check client meetings for notes on updated requirements for search feature and databases.
