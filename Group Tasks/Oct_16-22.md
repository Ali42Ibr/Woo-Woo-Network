Project Agenda


OCT 11-15


For this week all group members (Ali, Mohamad, Daven, David) are focusing on running the code from the previous teams. We are aiming to deploy both the frontend and the backend by the end of the week. We also looked into testing methodoogies, in order to develop a work flow that allows us to continuosly integrate the project. 

Moreover, we worked on the group presentation, each member was assigned a different component of the presentation: 

-Ali : Demonstrated functional requirements of our project with respect to the major milestones.
-Daven : Determined the non-functional requirements and the environmental constraints of the project.
-David : Worked on the Tech Stack and Testing Methodologies slides
-Mohamad : Delivered the high-level project description alongside the level 0 and 1 DFDs.

Furthermore, the team watched the group presentations and completed the group evaluations (each member contributed to the evaluations by asking questions and writing comments when proper).
