OCT 23- NOV 5:


For this week all group members (Ali, Mohamad, Daven, David) worked on and were finally able to deploy the website properly. Daven has not used react before and is currently making himself familiar with the process of "router.js" and the project files.

 We discussed the primary features our project sponsor is looking for whilst exploring what differs a client from a healer (and if any legal qualifications are to be presented when signing up as a healer). Client proivided us with her "legal papers" for the healer disclaimer that she made. 

We discussed further the functionality of the search feature we are trying to implment. Within the search feature, what parameters we are supposed to implement for users to be able to filter/search for a healer. 

Ali brought to her attention the disconnect between the firebase with all the accounts in it and the actual database used in our files to try and get some help from the previous team. 

We came up with a split for the features to implement:

Ali: Search bar
Mohamad: Admin page
David: Admin page
Daven: Map feature
