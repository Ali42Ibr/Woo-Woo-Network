Walthrough:

-	The spacing on the home page between the green healers’ button and the center description should be minimal (bring them together)
-	There are two buttons for healers (might be redundant)
-	When searching/filtering the healers, it should be on the page of healers not on the home page 
-	Add function to sort by/order by (distance shortest/longest, alphabetical, rating highest/lowest, price per hour highest/lowest)
-	On the healers’ page where the cards are shown, it seems like a lot of wasted space on the side. Almost too minimal 
-	In the cards should have a book now button, rating, maybe the tags shown as well 
-	Would rather input credit card info from personal account page or when booking the service with the healer
-	Figure out the sort when filter for pregnancy and marital should you show a healer that has both or healers that contain only pregnancy and only marital.


Think-aloud:

- user account should be displayed once user is logged in 
- once user is finished registering, page should automatically redirect to login page rather than disply popup that tells user to login
- healer filter buttons should be a dropdown menu
- scrolling down to see healer cards is not apparent - should integrate that into healers page
