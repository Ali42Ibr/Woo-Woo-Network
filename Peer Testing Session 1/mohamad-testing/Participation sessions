First session was with LIMS team 1:

Session was administrated by the student Carter Philips, and it was a user feedback session.

The testing was done over discord where I was provided with a link to the website. 

My screen was shared so that the Admin can record the session properly.

The admin provided a list of steps that I had to take, and all steps were easy and simple to maneuver.

I finally filled a heuristic evaluation form of my experience on their website.

Note: Simple and pleasant to use, straightforward.

Second session was with Checklick team 1:

Session was administrated by the student Jesse P.

The testing was done over zoom where I was provided with a remote access code to access the website. 

The testing was thorough and complete where I was provided with instructions and asked to go over the steps twice,
once on the old version of the website, and once on the newer revamped one.

The steps were simple and intuitive, admin provided minor assistance when needed.

Finally, I completed a heuristic evaluation form of my experience on their website.

Note: Website was designed nicely, the new design is more interactive and responsive with the user, and the new panels feel smoother to use.


***Both sessions were professional and done and completed with no problems.***
