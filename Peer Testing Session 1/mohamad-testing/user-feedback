User Feedback Session (Admin):

Admin: Mohamad Agha
Participant: Coleton Weninger

User was instructed to complete specific testing steps as shown via a testing document made by the group.

User started by signing up and creating a test account. 

User was able to find the Sign up page with no trouble.

User moves on to the login page after being alerted by the website that an account has been successfully created.

User then finds login page with easy, types in credentials, and is taken the home page with no problems.

User moves on to using the search feature, where he needed some help by telling him to wait till healers are properly loaded, he then manipulates search using tags.

User wonders how the tags work, and the admin explains how tags correspond to services and how search can be used to query for certain healer names.

User then tests by searching for a healer with their name, and gets the correct result.

User tries to book, where he is told that booking functionality is still not properly working at the moment.

Finally, user accesses the about us page, and then they sign up as a healer, completing the steps listed in the documents.

After the recording is over and remote access is ended, user was instructed to fill a google form for heuristic evaluation.

Note: Admin showed the user how bookings would work if a verified user was on the website, where we get a calendar system, 
and we're able to choose different services and prices to book.

The user mentioned that the system is straightforward to use, however stated that it could get hard finding certain parts if stuck.

***Video recording of this session was done through zoom, the audio is there and the zoom screen is there, 
however the recording of the screen itself where the user was working was not captured for some reason.***
