Admin session (not think aloud): participant did not show

Admin session (think aloud): notes taken from Mohamad testing session with Druv (same participant - same issues)

search functionality works properly
liked the functionality and design of search tags 
liked aesthetics of map integration 
primary issue with booking appointment, where user clicked profile expected to be directed to the page 
suggestion that clicking the profile would take you to that page
and learn more is not necessary, or does something else.
liked overall design and colors
