Peer testing #2 Woo Woo Network 

Complete the following tasks 

Introduction : 

The Woo Woo Network is a platform focused on helping people via spiritual healing.
Since spiritual healing “Energy Medicine” is a scarce service, the platform proposed by our project sponsor, Kimberlee Klein, aims to provide a place where healers can provide their services to clients who need them. The website will connect clients with a variety of options for spiritual healers who will aid them with their healing process.

A user is a potential customer of the site. In the context of the project it would be someone that is looking for a spiritual healer. 

Users can navigate the website, sign up, create an account, book appointments, look for healers nearby and more. 

User : 

User sign up 
User log in 
User uses tags to search for a healer (search takes a while to load, click the search field first and wait till options show up, then use tags to manipulate search)
