User ThinkAloud Session (Admin):

Admin: Mohamad Agha
Participant: Anthony Abou Khalil

User was instructed to complete specific testing steps as shown via a testing document made by the group.

User started by navigating to the sign up on the top navigation bar. 

User states that he found the Sign up page with no trouble whatsoever, and started creating the test account by filling fields.

User is alerted that an account is created, and they move to the login page instantly as it's by the sign up on the navbar.

User fills in account details and is taken the home page with no trouble.

User gets the "verify email before continuing alert", and was told that it's not needed for the sake of the testing.

User goes on to test the search feature, where he clicks a tag first then the search field.

Healers with the selected tag are properly loaded, he then clicks one of the healers and tries to book.

User notices the booking functionality isn't working since the account is not verified so they move on.

User then tries to find the About Us Page, they scroll down and access it properly.

Finally, user voices their last step which is to sign up as a healer, 
and they do with ease by accessing the sign up page again and checking the healer option.

Recording is ended and remote access is stopped, user was then instructed to fill a google form for heuristic evaluation.

Note: Admin showed the user how bookings would work if a verified user was on the website, where we get a calendar system, 
and we're able to choose different services and prices to book.

User mentioned that the system is simple to use and maneuver, 
but stated that the verification process should be looked into for the full experience.
