Project Description 

The Woo Woo Network is a platform focused on helping people via spiritual healing. 

Since spiritual healing “Energy Medicine” is a scarce service, the platform proposed by our project sponsor Kimberlee Klein aims to provide a place where healers can provide their services to clients who need them. The website will connect clients with a variety of options for spiritual healers who will aid them with their healing process. 

The project aims to develop a complete website that allows clients to register, search and find healers, schedule appointments and pay for them.
