Working on fixing Stripe.
error: BadRequest [Error]: You did not provide an API key. You need to provide your API key in the Authorization header, 
using Bearer auth (e.g. 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY'). See https://stripe.com/docs/api#authentication for details, or we can help at https://support.stripe.com/.

To fix: After some looking, I found the API key and fixed the .env file. But now I am getting a new error, "can't use publishable key'. Stripe wants me 
to use the secret key, but it is not accepting it. Looking at the logs, I can see my request is not generating any headers. 

I contacted support and tried some fixes online without any results.

Also worked on fixing Positionstack, the geolocation API. It is returning a 502 error which is undocumented. I emailed positionstack and they replied saying
there is an error they are working on. 

Currently I cannot continue testing the website fully until Stripe is working, over the break I'll have to edit the code to be able to test without Stripe.

March 2nd

Geolocation API is fixed.
Location can now *optionally* be added from signup as well as it being synced to users that sign up.


March 9th.

Stripe is working fine, but is taking some time to switch to "testing" mode, so that I am able to start the final testing.


March 15th.

Accounts are able to create services & schedules. But the schedule is not being saved in the database, although it is properly sent to the back end.
Need to review HealerSchedule schema.
