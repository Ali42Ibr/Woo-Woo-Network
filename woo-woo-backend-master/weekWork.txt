Working on fixing Stripe.

Problem #1:BadRequest [Error]: You did not provide an API key. You need to provide your API key in the Authorization header, 
using Bearer auth (e.g. 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET_KEY'). See https://stripe.com/docs/api#authentication for details, or we can help at https://support.stripe.com/.

To fix: After some looking, I found the API key and fixed the .env file. But now I am getting a new error, "can't use publishable key'. Stripe wants me 
to use the secret key, but it is not accepting it. Looking at the logs, I can see my request is not generating any tags.
